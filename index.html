											<h1>Beyond Steps:<br />
											 Challenges and Opportunities in Fitness Tracking</h1>
										</header>
										<p>

											The 1st Beyond Steps 2020 workshop will be held in conjunction with Ubicomp/ISWC 2020 (Cancún, Mexico). We are delighted to bring people together from academia and industry to share their latest research, thoughts and ideas with other members in the community!
										</p>
											

										<h3>About The Workshop</h3>

										<p>

											The quantified-self is a positive and prevalent aspect of our culture that has progressed during the last decade propelled by technological advances in health and fitness tracking. Prior research has shown that self tracking has a myriad of benefits. And we have the ability to sense and track various aspects of fitness and well-being. However one key challenge that remains is what data needs to be shown to the user, and how to present it to the user. Moreover, when is the right time to deliver key information to the user. Secondly, we have noticed that self-monitoring and tracking research has mostly evolved in isolation <i>i.e.,</i> researchers have separately studied or built systems for various aspects of fitness like exercise tracking, diet or sleep monitoring. While in reality many of these areas are intertwined and depend on each other: Poor sleep can lead to overeating and consequently weight gain. <b>In this workshop</b>, we propose to highlight and address these two challenges and explore opportunities to expand beyond the current paradigm of single health factors tracking to a more comprehensive fitness tracking.

										<h2>Call For Papers</h2>
									</header>

									<p>

										Fitness tracking has become a growing culture all around the world. In the past decade, academic and industrial research has offered a plethora of solutions enabling users to track their exercise, diet, and sleep activities. They aim to help users achieve specific goals, but in practice these trackers operate independently from each other. This disconnect can lead to incomplete or contradicting feedback to the user. In this workshop we focus on three aspects of fitness:

										<ol>
											<li> Physical exercise </li>

											<li> Diet </li>

											<li> Sleeping activity </li>

										</ol>

										We invite submissions for position papers that address fitness-tracking challenging questions, including but not limited to:

										<ol>

										<li> Which activities should we sense, and how? </li>

										<li> What information is appropriate and useful to present? </li>

										<li> When is the right time for feedback and intervention? </li>

										<li> How to consolidate data from multiple sensing systems for dependent inferences? For example, it might be useful for a user to know that they are more likely to over eat if they sleep less than 5 hours the night before. </li>

										</ol>

										This workshop represents an opportunity for academics and practitioners to exchange knowledge and brainstorm ideas for novel solutions addressing the present fitness tracking challenges. We encourage submissions that highlight potential preliminary research and thought-provoking ideas. 
										All submissions must be original work not previously published or under review at any other venue. The workshop will accept completed works, positions papers, and work-in-progress but the emphasis is on radical ideas of how we can further the field of fitness tracking. We also invite authors to submit <b>Challenge</b> papers that identify and discuss new challenges in the field.

										</br></br>

										Submissions should not exceed 6 pages (including references). Reviews will be single-blind: authors name and affiliation should be included in the submission. All submissions will be reviewed by at least two members of the workshop organizing committee. Papers will be accepted based on their quality, novelty, relevance to the workshop topic, and their potential to spark a fruitful discussion.

										<ol>
											<li> 
												Paper submission deadline: June 19, 2020
											</li>
